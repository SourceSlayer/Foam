Add this point in time, Foam is far from complete and I have not even decided if I want to keep the name Foam. At this point in time, I don't even have a list of features I want to implement.

Here is a list of software Foam uses:
- Python
- sys module (in python standard library)
- PySide
- Keyring


Plans for this project can be found at http://www.github.com/SourceSlayer/wiki/Plans

Thank you!
